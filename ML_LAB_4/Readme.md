# Implement the following variants of regression problems:  
  
1. Simple linear regression, Multiple linear regression, and Polynomial regression of degree M.  
2. Ridge regression.  
3. LASSO regression.    
4. Elastic-Net regression.    
5. Bridge regression.  
  
# Regarding dataset used :  

* For all the cases, assume 20 samples from sin(x) curve over the interval of 0 to 2 pi. So, the
observed samples (or target samples) = sin(x) + noise. You can assume that the noise follow a
Gaussian distribution with mean 0 and variance 1.  
* Generate another 20 new samples from sin(x) curve and find out the mean square error between
the predicted values (from the obtained best model) and the true values (obtained from the sin(x)
curve).  
* For multiple regression, you look for any real-time dataset like “Cars dataset from kaggle”. Use
some of the variables in the dataset as independent and one of them as dependent variable.
