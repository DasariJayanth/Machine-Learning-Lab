# Problem Statement:   

**Support Vector Machine (SVM) for Linearly/Non-linearly Separable Data**  
  
## Task-1  
Generate samples from Guassian distributions N(mu1, sigma1) and N(mu2, sigma2), and labelled them as +1 (class-1) and -1 (class-2), respectively.    
1. 200 samples for each of the classes.  
2. Randomly select 80% samples from both the classes and use them to learn linear hyper-plane using SVM.  
3. Test rest of 20% samples from both the classes, and indicate the accuracy obtained by you.  
  
## Task-2  
Generate samples from Guassian distributions N(mu3, sigma3) and N(mu4, sigma4), and labelled them as +1 (class-1) and -1 (class-2), respectively.    
1. 200 samples for each of the classes.  
2. Randomly select 80% samples from both the classes and use them to learn a non-linear hyper-plane by employing different kernel functions (linear, polynomial, radial-basis, and chi-squared) in SVM.  
3. Test rest of 20% samples from both the classes, and indicate the accuracy obtained by you for different kernels.  
  
  
Where,  
mu1 = [-10 -10], and sigma1 = [[1 0][0 1]]  
mu2 = [10 10], and sigma2 = [[1 0][0 1]]  
mu3 = [0 0], and sigma3 = [[1 0][0 1]]  
mu4 = [1 1], and sigma4 = [[1 0][0 1]]
