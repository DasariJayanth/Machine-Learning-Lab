# Problem-1  
  
How do we define ‘classes’ and ‘objects’ in python ?  (2 programs)  
1. How to initialize ‘public’ and ‘private’ variables?  
2. How to define function within a class ?  
3. How ‘objects’ of a class can access functions and variables of that class?  
  
# Problem-2
  
Define two or more classes (like student and people) and illustrate the
following concepts using python programming:  
1. Function overloading  
2. Inheritance  
    
# Problem-3  
  
Define three classes (for example : “A”, ‘B’, and ‘C’ .. You may define
something else) separately and save it AA.py, BB.py, and CC.py   
  
1. Write a new .py file where you need to define some objects and call each of the
classes using “import A from AA”,“import B from BB” , and “import C from
CC”.
